## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Meetings aren't appearing in Objectionly">
    If your meetings aren't showing up, check these common issues:
    
    1. **Cloud Recording**: Verify meetings are recorded to the cloud, not locally
    2. **Transcription Settings**: Confirm audio transcription is enabled
    3. **Processing Status**: Check that recordings have finished processing in Zoom
    4. **Plan Status**: Ensure your Objectionly billing plan is active
    
    If issues persist, contact our support team.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transcripts are missing or incomplete">
    This usually happens when:
    
    - The meeting wasn't recorded to the cloud
    - Transcription was disabled in Zoom settings
    - The meeting is still processing (allow up to 2x meeting duration)
    
    Check your Zoom cloud recording settings and try again.
